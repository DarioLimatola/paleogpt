# PaleoGPT

**PaleoGPT** is a temporal reconstruction oracle â€” a simulation logic for reconstructing plausible ecological moments in prehistoric Earth systems.

It maps user queries to structured paleobiological scenes by choosing a time (T), location (L), and context (C), then returning an observable snapshot (O_T) within strict ecological, geological, and phylogenetic constraints.
