### Prompt
"A cute and weird avian dinosaur in a misty Cretaceous forest."

### Inferred
- T: ~125 Ma (Early Cretaceous)
- L: Liaoning, Northeastern China
- C: Temperate conifer forest, dawn, early spring
- Q: Cute + weird → favors juvenile Jeholornis with ornamental tail display

### Output Snapshot
A down-covered juvenile Jeholornis grips a low, damp branch. Dew slicks its claws.
It bobs rhythmically, puffing up its protofeathers. Exaggerated tail streamers twitch.
Ferns and seed ferns below rot in humid leaf litter. Mist clings to fungal fans.
No large predators visible — only distant rustling and the creak of ancient conifers.
